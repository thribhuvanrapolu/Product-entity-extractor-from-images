* Problem statement for Amazon ML Hackathon
* We have used donut to extract entity from images
* Whats unique about our solution is you dont need to mention what type of entity do we need from the product. The model will automatically recognize the type of entity and its value
* We were able to train the model for the given dataset by amazon but unable to test it due to gpu power and time constraints
